        This systematic review compiles research on AI applications in education, emphasizing personalized learning, adaptive assessment, and intelligent tutoring. The authors analyze empirical studies to identify where AI has improved learning outcomes and where evidence is still thin. They highlight tools like AI tutors, adaptive curricula, and automated feedback systems, and discuss pedagogical and equity concerns—especially the digital divide and risks of overreliance on automated feedback. The paper’s strength lies in synthesizing a range of experimental and real-world deployments, pointing to both promising directions and gaps (e.g., long-term learning retention and socio-emotional impacts) that future research must address.

        This research introduces Physics-STAR, a tutoring framework that uses a large language model to provide adaptive, step-by-step guidance for physics learners. The authors report a controlled pilot showing improved comprehension and efficiency compared with generic LLM help and lecture instruction. The system focuses on fostering deep understanding through guided questioning, scaffolded prompts, and reflective tasks rather than merely supplying answers. The paper is notable because it presents an applied LLM system with measured learning gains and discusses design decisions that support conceptual understanding—making it directly relevant for educators exploring LLM-based instructional tools.
