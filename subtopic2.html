        Compiled within this articles are applications of AI in our education system. It emphasizes personalized learning, adaptive assessment, and intelligent tutoring. Author Shan Wang analyzes studies meant to identify whether or not AI has improves learning outcomes in our. They highlight tools such as AI tutors, automated feedback systems, and on top of this discuss concerns of equity. Especially the digital divide and the risk of students in schools relying too much on automated feedback AI. Wang's strength in this paper lies in pointing to the proper research and issues in educational use of AI that future research must address.

      <td>
        Within this article lies research that introduces Physics-STAR, an AI tutoring framework that provides step-by-step guidance for physics learners. Zhoumingju Jiang shows proof of a controlled pilot shwoing improvement in his comprehension and efficiency when compares with generic instruction through lecture. Physics-STAR concentrates on fostering deep understanding through guided questioning and reflective-based tasks rather than only providing answers. Jiang's research in this article is notable because it presents a system of AI that has improved the ability of numerous pilots. These instructional tools could very well change how we learn in all facets of life in the coming years.
