        The OECD Employment Outlook (2023) evaluates how AI and automation affect jobs, skills, and inequality across member countries. It provides evidence that while certain occupations face significant automation risk, the aggregate labor market has shown resilience so far. The report emphasizes that AI's effects are uneven: some workers gain wage premiums through complementary skills while others face job narrowing or displacement. It recommends policy measures—such as reskilling programs, social safety nets, and measures to broaden access to AI technologies—to ensure inclusive benefits. As a policy-oriented, data-rich source, the OECD report is an essential reference for understanding national and international implications of AI on work.

        This Brookings article synthesizes recent empirical research (including Yale Budget Lab findings) showing that generative AI has not, to date, produced broad job losses in the U.S. labor market. The piece argues that while AI is changing the mix of tasks within occupations—augmenting some tasks and automating others—the evidence points to gradual transformation rather than sudden displacement. The article highlights that societal impacts will depend on adoption patterns, complementary investments (training and management), and policy responses. It is useful for grounding public debate in current empirical evidence and cautioning against alarmist predictions absent long-term data.
