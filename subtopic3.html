      <td>
        The excerpt observes the manner in which AI and automation impact jobs and skills in the modern day. This OECD proves that while certain occupations are potentially at risk due to AI automation, the collective labor market has shown resilience thus far.  AI's effects appear to be uneven: some workers gain wage premiums through the skills they attain through AI usage while others face potential job loss. This excerpt from the OECD recommends a number of solutions, most of all it delves into measures to broaden access to AI technologies to ensure inclusive benefits. AI should benefit us, not take us out of a job. Undoubtedly, this OECD report is indispensible to truly understand the international implications of AI in the work place.

        Brookings Institution produces this article that explains recent research that shows how generative AI has not, to date, cost the US jobs in any significant manner. While AI is actively changing how many occupations operate, the evidence points to a gradual transformation of these occupations rather than them simply disappearing. The conclusion this article ultimately comes to is that how the job market is impacted by AI will depend on how it's integrated, who is investing in development, and government policy. Brookings provides a resource here that calms the winds cautioning against alarmist predictions regarding AI that lack long-term data.
